Project overview:
  Finance-splitting-program is a program that allows simple and efficient splitting of finances, with a retrievable overview one command away. The input for this program consists of      the expenditure of each individual within a community of people that want to split costs. Data is collected with accessible user input prompts that make the process efficient and       easy to understand. The program is able to create basic computations that allow individuals of the community to regulate and organize the way expenses are shared, by dividing the       money owed amongst those who are supposed to contribute to the financing of the expenditure. More specifically who is supposed to contribute to the financing of the cost is a           flexible variable, as, perhaps, not every cost is shared amongst everyone in this group of participants.

Libraries:
  - Numpy - The package makes use of Numpy for simple matrix calculations.
  - Patch from unittest.mock - The package makes use of Patch in the pytesting process, but not for the actual code.
  - Pytest - The package makes use of pytest for pytesting, but not for the actual code.

Data requirements:
  The program requires no input data in form of a file. Almst all the data used in this program is obtained through user input prompts. The only exception is the data used to create      the prompts. This is input into the functions, for which docstrings are provided. In that sense, there are no true requirements for the data.

Ideal outcome:
  Ideally, the program will provide an overview on the debts owed by each person. This data is stored in a dictionary containing a matrix for each participant. Retrieved data is made     more accessible by making it part of a printed statement that explains the meaning of each value.

Why you should use this program:
This program should be able to provide you with an easy way to manage your finances. Our developers are constantly trying to improve this program to suit your needs as well as possible. Using this would, not only facilitate easy finance overviews, but also allow us to continue learning and building upon what we have created thus far.
