# Description for two different python program proposals; one on wind data visualisation, and the other on finance splitting:

I have written proposals for two different projects that utilize a python script for the processing of input data for an output that is either tedious, although not difficult to calculate, or for the visualization of data on a map, for easier interpretation, including data interpolation. The two proposals are as follows:

Proposal 1:
My first proposal is for a script that takes wind data, combined with GNSS data to plot wind vectors on the map of a certain area, creating a sort of direction field with arrows pointing towards the wind direction, and their size representing the magnitude of the wind. If the input data is incomplete, the script should be able to interpolate the data to fill the blank areas of the map. This way, the output of the script should be a map with an overlaying layer of arrows indicating the magnitude and direction of airflow.

Proposal 2:
My second proposal is a program in which the input of data is the expenditure of each individual within a community of people that want to split costs. The program should be able to create basic computations that allow individuals of the community to regulate and organize the way expenses are shared, by dividing the money owed amongst those who are supposed to contribute to the financing of the expenditure. More specifically who is supposed to contribute to the financing of the cost should be a flexible variable, as, perhaps, not every cost is shared amongst everyone in this group of participants.

In the end, I decided to opt for the finance-splitting code (Proposal 2), as I felt like this data is more accessible for use and testing. I am currently at the very beginning of developing this code, and have so far been able to write a few code lines to  be able to start a new finance-splitting collaboration, with i number of named participants, and a chosen name for the project.
